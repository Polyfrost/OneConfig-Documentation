# Getting Started

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is **NOT** a guide on how to start with modding or set up a modding template. There is documentation for every version of Minecraft that we support on how to set up a mod on their loader.

For Forge 1.8.9 and 1.12.2: [https://moddev.nea.moe/ide-setup/](https://moddev.nea.moe/ide-setup/)

For Forge (modern): [https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/latest/gettingstarted/](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/latest/gettingstarted/)

For Fabric: [https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:start#creating\_your\_first\_mod](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:start#creating\_your\_first\_mod)

For NeoForge: [https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/gettingstarted/](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/gettingstarted/)

From there, instead of using the default templates of those loaders, you would use the [OneConfigExampleMod](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfigExampleMod).
{% endhint %}

## OneConfig Example Mod

If you're just starting out or need more advanced features like multiple versions, we highly recommend looking at our [example mod](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfigExampleMod/).

## Including OneConfig yourself

If you don't want to use our mod template, or wish to include OneConfig in one of your new or existing mods, add this to your `build.gradle(.kts)`
