# Getting Started with Modding

## What is modding?

Welcome to Minecraft modding! These next few pages will serve as a basic guide for how to get started with Minecraft modding, how to use IntelliJ, Gradle and some Java basics. Minecraft mods are added to the game most commonly using a **loader**, such as [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) or [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/). The term 'mod' refers to modification for a game, Minecraft in our case. Minecraft is written in Java, so naturally so are its mods.

**You will need some basic knowledge of coding to do this.** But don't worry! Java is reasonably easy to pick up, being an Object Orientated Programming (OOP) language with a reasonably easy to understand syntax. You might want to watch a YouTube tutorial on Java before you begin to help you out.

## Step 1: Installing IntelliJ IDEA

For this tutorial, we are going to use the OneConfig Example Mod [**which can be found here**](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfigExampleMod)**.** We are going to use IntelliJ IDEA as our IDE for our coding, and this is the IDE of choice for many mod developers and Java developers.

Firstly, head to [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and download the IDE for your platform, in my case Windows. I recommend the Community Edition for casual developers as it has all the features you need, and it's free! Download, and follow the prompts to get it installed.

Once that has downloaded, open up your File Explorer, and create yourself a directory for all your mods, for example **C:/Users/Bob/Documents/Minecraft Mods/.**

## Step 2: Creating the Project

Great job! You have installed IntelliJ and are ready to clone the project. Now, open up IntelliJ and you should be greeted with a screen a bit like this (make sure to accept the terms first):

Now, click **Get from VCS** and go to **Repository URL** and check that **Version Control** is set to **Git**. Next, **set the directory to that root folder you made earlier**, and in the **URL** box input [https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfigExampleMod](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfigExampleMod). Add the **name of your mod to the end of the end of the directory**, so for this tutorial, I'm just going to call it "ExampleMod". It should now look something like this:

![IntelliJ Clone screen](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)

If that all looks good, go ahead and click **Clone** and click Next below to continue with the guide!
